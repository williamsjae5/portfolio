<h2> Who's Jada? </h2>
<p> Hello, I am Jada Williams. I am 17 years old and I am a Senior at CMA High School. I play a few different sports there, I play basketball, softball, and I run cross country. When I was in middle school I played basketball, volleyball, and softball. I have been playing sports since the 5th grade. I am respectful and I am a fast learner. I also love to sing and listen to music, I have been singing since  I could remember. I wrote my first song when I was six years old. When I’m not doing any of those things, I am sleeping.

I like playing sports because they help me in some ways. Sports help me stay focus, they help me keep my grades up in school, they help me be disciplined, and they help me in many other ways. Singing is my first passion. I love singing because I’m good at it, singing makes me happy and it helps me take my mind off of things. I like to sleep because it is relaxing and comfortable. </p>
